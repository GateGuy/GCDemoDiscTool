In order to package a GBA game for use in the Gamecube's GBA emulator, you must extract zz_MarioVSDonkey_game.tgc (the Mario vs. Donkey Kong demo) from Interactive Multi-Game Demo Disc Version 16 and place it in this directory.

zz_MarioPinballLand_game.tgc (the Mario Pinball Land demo from Interactive Multi-Game Demo Disc Version 17/18) should also work, but it is untested.
